A multiset is an unordered collection of values. They are also known as bags.

Unlike sets where each value is either included or not, multisets permit duplicates. Consequently, they're useful for maintaining a count of distinct values.

See the documentation of [HashMultiSet](https://docs.rs/multiset/0.0.5/multiset/struct.HashMultiSet.html) for examples.
